flashular
=========

A simple flash service for AngularJS that provides a means with which to pass temporary objects between routes (or "states", if using [UI Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) terminology). Anything you place in the flash is exposed to the very next route and then immediately cleared out, making it somewhat similar to the [Rails flash](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash.html). Also comes with a Twitter Bootstrap-compatible directive for displaying flash alerts.
